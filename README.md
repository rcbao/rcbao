## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Robert.

* I study Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://virginia.edu). Previously, I interned at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [CallMiner](https://callminer.com).
* Iâ€™ve done lots of full-stack work through past projects. This summer, I built a generative AI service during an internship (while maintaining another one I made at school).
* Outside of work, I enjoy listening to podcasts and watching movies. My all-time favtorite movies are _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ and _Soul_. My current favorite podcasts are _Freakonomics Radio_ and _Acquired_.

I also like taking pictures! Here are some of the photos I took over the years.
